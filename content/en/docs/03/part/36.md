{{% alert title="Implementation" color="warning" %}} **Do not make the described changes below to your implementation.**

The only code change needed is described in Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 and targets your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

In this section we explain the changes made to the `order` and `stock` microservice. At the end of the section you will
be switching to the provided pre-built docker images which contain all these changes.
{{% /alert %}}

Both our microservices use local transactions to store their data. There are several cases where data may get out of sync between
`order` and `stock` microservice.


## Problem

Think of the following scenario.

* New order is requested using the RESTful API
  * Order microservice will create and store a new order
  * Order microservice will trigger the `stock` microservice to change the amount of in-stock items.
  * Stock microservice changes the stock count and returns successfully.
  * Order microservice fails for any reason
  
![Monolith Split](../../data-inconsistency.png)

Since the stock successfully applied the reservation, and the order microservice failed, this results in an inconsistent state.


## MicroProfile LRA (Long Running Actions)

{{% alert title="Motivation for Long Running Actions" color="primary" %}} The proposal introduces annotations and APIs for services to coordinate
long running activities whilst still maintaining loose coupling and doing so in such a way as to guarantee a globally
consistent outcome without the need to take locks on data. [...]

Traditional techniques for guaranteeing consistency in distributed environments has focused on XA transactions where
locks may be held for long periods thereby introducing strong coupling between services and decreasing concurrency to
unacceptable levels. Additionally, if such a transaction aborts then valuable work which may be valid will be rolled back.
In view of these issues an alternative approach is desirable. - [github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-lra-spec.adoc) {{% /alert %}}

LRA Protocol Sequence - source: [github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/images/lra.png)
![LRA Sequence](../../lra-sequence.png)

The MicroProfile LRA is built for microservices with RESTful communication. Each microservice participating in a LRA will have
to provide a compensate action which will be invoked if the transaction is cancelled. The life cycle of LRAs can be
managed by annotating the JAX-RS resources with the following annotations.

   Annotation   |   Description
----------------|----------------------
`@LRA`          | Controls the life cycle of an LRA.
`@Compensate`   | Indicates that the method should be invoked if the LRA is cancelled.
`@Complete`     | Indicates that the method should be invoked if the LRA is closed.
`@Forget`       | Indicates that the method may release any resources that were allocated for this LRA.
`@Leave`        | Indicates that this class is no longer interested in this LRA.
`@Status`       | When the annotated method is invoked it should report the status.
`@AfterLRA`     | When an LRA has reached a final state the annotated method is invoked.

See the basic sample below.
```java
@Path("/")
@ApplicationScoped
public class SimpleLRAParticipant {
    @LRA(LRA.Type.REQUIRES_NEW)
    @Path("/cdi")
    @PUT
    public void doInTransaction(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId) {
        /*
         * Perform business actions in the context of the LRA identified by the
         * value in the injected JAX-RS header. This LRA was started just before
         * the method was entered (REQUIRES_NEW) and will be closed when the
         * method finishes at which point the completeWork method below will be
         * invoked.
         */

## Handling Compensations

What does providing a compensation mean to our microservices?

Each operation like order creation is run in a LRA context. The LRA context is reflected by an
associated lra Id. The `lraId` will be injected in the HTTP-Headers. The call for compensation will also contain
this id. This means that we must be able to revert our database changes by using the lra id whenever a REST call is
made to the method annotated with `@Compensate`.


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - How to track LRAs

Think of compensating an order, which changes are necessary to our entities that we can revert the change later on?

{{% details title="Task Hint" %}}
Lets assume the LRA with id `lra-1` needs to be compensated.

To compensate the database changes we need to know:

* Which order is created by `lra-1`
  * If the order is compensated we set a different order status
* Which articles were reserved by `lra-1`
  * If the order is compensated we have to revert the stock deduction

For this to achieve a simple approach could be:

* Store `lra-1` which was used to create the order in the `ShopOrder` entity.
* Track the `ArticleOrder` with the associated `lra-1` in the `stock` microservice as a new table/entity `articlestockchange`
{{% /details %}}
  

## Database Changes

This leads to the following changes in our database schema for the `order` microservice.

```xml
<changeSet author="lra" id="2">
  <comment>Add LRA field to store associated lra-id</comment>
  <addColumn tableName="shoporder">
    <column name="lra" type="varchar(255)" />
  </addColumn>
</changeSet>
```

On the `stock` microservice we will add the following migration to create a new table `articlestockchange`.
```xml
<createTable tableName="articlestockchange">
  <column name="id" type="bigint">
    <constraints primaryKey="true" nullable="false"/>
  </column>
  <column name="article_id" type="bigint">
    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="articlestockchange_article_fk" referencedColumnNames="id"/>
  </column>
  <column name="count" type="int"/>
  <column name="lra" type="varchar(255)"/>
</createTable>
```


## LRA Coordinator

The LRA management will be made by an LRA coordinator. The Narayana Transaction Manager[^1], which is the default JTA
Transaction manager in Quarkus and WildFly Application servers, provides an implementation of an LRA Coordinator.

We will use this coordinator for our environment. Therefore, the following changes are made in the `docker/docker-compose.yaml`:

Add LRA Coordinator (do not forget to add the volume)
```yaml
  lra-coordinator:
    image: quay.io/jbosstm/lra-coordinator:latest
    hostname: lra-coordinator
    container_name: rest-lra-coordinator
    volumes:
      - lra-data:/opt/jboss
    networks:
      - rest
    ports:
      - 8090:8080
    environment:
      - THORNTAIL_LOGGING_ROOT-LOGGER.LEVEL=DEBUG

# ... omitted

volumes:
  # ....
  lra-data:
```


## Dependencies

Our application includes the following dependency in the `pom.xml`.

GroupId      |   ArtifactId               | Description
-------------|----------------------------|-----------------
`org.jboss.narayana.rts` | `narayana-lra` | Provides MicroProfile LRA implementation

{{% alert title="Bridged Docker Network" color="primary" %}}
The library uses the base url extracted form the request-uri to register itself at the LRA Coordinator. Our
lab runs in a bridged docker network. Our requests are made to `localhost` with the mapped port of the docker host and
are bridged to the container port inside the docker network.

This is why the `order` microservice would register itself as `localhost` if we call the `order` microservice with `http://localhost:8080/shop-orders` from the docker host.

To fix this environment specific issue we rewrite the host of the incoming requests from `localhost` to `order`.
The registering at the LRA coordinator is therefore made correctly with `order` instead of `localhost`
{{% /alert %}}


To fix the docker network issue and specify the needed system variables we add the following to the `order` container specification:
```yaml
  order:
    # ... omitted
    environment:
      - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dlra.http.host=lra-coordinator -Dlra.http.port=8080
      - APPLICATION_REWRITE_BASE_ENABLED=true
      - APPLICATION_REWRITE_BASE_HOST=order

  stock:
    # ... omitted
    environment:
      - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dlra.http.host=lra-coordinator -Dlra.http.port=8080
      - APPLICATION_REWRITE_BASE_ENABLED=true
      - APPLICATION_REWRITE_BASE_HOST=stock
```


## Using LRAs

Now we are going to change our code to make use of LRAs. We have to annotate the JAX-RS resources with the specific LRA-Annotations.


### Changes in Order Microservice

We have to make the following changes to our `ch.puzzle.mm.rest.order.boundary.ShopOrderResource`

Annotate the `POST` method `createShopOrder` and specify the HeaderParams to be used to extract the LRA ID.
The extracted LRA ID will be stored in the database to be able to complete or compensate the LRA.
```java
@POST
@ChaosMonkey
@LRA(value = LRA.Type.REQUIRES_NEW,
        cancelOn = {
                Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR // cancel on a 500 code
        },
        cancelOnFamily = {
                Response.Status.Family.CLIENT_ERROR // cancel on any 4xx code
        })
public Response createShopOrder(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraUrl,
                                ShopOrderDTO shopOrderDTO) {
        // extract lraId from headerstring
        String lraId = getLraId(lraUrl);

        // create ShopOrder locally
        ShopOrder shopOrder = shopOrderService.createOrder(shopOrderDTO, lraId);

        // call remote service
        articleStockService.orderArticles(shopOrderDTO.articleOrders);

        return Response.ok(shopOrder).build();
}
```

Implement `@Complete` method and set the `COMPLETE` status for this order. The LRA expects us to return the Status.
```java
@PUT
@Path("/complete")
@Complete
@Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
@Transactional
public Response completeShopOrder(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraUrl) {
    // extract lraId from headerstring
    String lraId = getLraId(lraUrl);

    int updated = ShopOrder.setStatusByLra(ShopOrderStatus.COMPLETED, lraId);

    return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Completed.name()).build();
}
```

Implement `@Compensate` method and set the `INCOMPLETE` status. Also return the Status for the LRA.
```java
@PUT
@Path("/compensate")
@Compensate
@Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
@Transactional
public Response compensateShopOrder(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraUrl) {
    // extract lraId from headerstring
    String lraId = getLraId(lraUrl);

    int updated = ShopOrder.setStatusByLra(ShopOrderStatus.INCOMPLETE, lraId);

    return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Compensated.name()).build();
}
```

Further you have to add a simple method to extract the LRA-id
```java
String getLraId(String longRunningHeader) {
    return longRunningHeader.substring(longRunningHeader.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);
}
```

[Complete Source of ShopOrderResource]({{% param "solution_rawgit_repo" %}}/{{% param "folder_rest" %}}/rest-order/src/main/java/ch/puzzle/mm/rest/order/boundary/ShopOrderResource.java)

We have also added method to the `ShopOrder` entity to change the ShopOrder by a given `lraId`. The entity also includes the lra field which we've been added to our database schema.
```java
@Entity
public class ShopOrder extends PanacheEntity {

    @NotNull
    @Column(unique=true, nullable = false)
    private String lra;

    // omitted

    public String getLra() {
        return lra;
    }

    public void setLra(String lra) {
        this.lra = lra;
    }

    public static int setStatusByLra(ShopOrderStatus status, String lra) {
        return update("status = :status where lra = :lra",
                Parameters.with("status", status).and("lra", lra));
    }
}
```

[Complete Source of ShopOrder]({{% param "solution_rawgit_repo" %}}/{{% param "folder_rest" %}}/rest-order/src/main/java/ch/puzzle/mm/rest/order/entity/ShopOrder.java)


Our `ShopOrderService` now takes an additional argument the `lraId` which is stored in the newly created field on the ShopOrder entity.
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class ShopOrderService {

    @Transactional
    public ShopOrder createOrder(ShopOrderDTO dto, String lra) {
        // omitted

        // set lra id
        shopOrder.setLra(lra);

        // omitted
    }
}
```

[Complete Source of ShopOrderService]({{% param "solution_rawgit_repo" %}}/{{% param "folder_rest" %}}/rest-order/src/main/java/ch/puzzle/mm/rest/order/control/ShopOrderService.java)


At the end we switch our rest-client to the LRA-Enabled version for the stock service by changing the path to `@Path("/lra/article-stocks")`.

[Complete Source of ArticleStockService]({{% param "solution_rawgit_repo" %}}/{{% param "folder_rest" %}}/rest-order/src/main/java/ch/puzzle/mm/rest/stock/boundary/ArticleStockService.java)


### Changes in Stock Microservice

{{% alert title="Pre-built Container" color="info" %}} The pre-built version of
`{{% param "puzzle_docker_repo" %}}/{{% param "image_prefix" %}}rest-stock:latest` supports both versions, the
original one and the LRA enabled rest endpoint. That's why there exists a second JAX-RS resource `ArticleStockLraResource`
in the solution code.
{{% /alert %}}

We have to make the following changes to our `ch.puzzle.mm.rest.stock.boundary.ArticleStockResource`

Annotate the `POST` method `createStockOrder` and specify the HeaderParams to be used to extract the LRA ID.
The extracted LRA ID will be stored in the database to be able to complete or compensate the LRA.
```java
@POST
@ChaosMonkey
@LRA(value = LRA.Type.MANDATORY, end = false)
public Response createStockOrder(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraUrl,
                                 List<ArticleOrderDTO> articles) {
    // extract lraId from headerstring
    String lraId = getLraId(lraUrl);

    // handle stock count
    articleStockService.orderArticles(articles, lraId);
}
```


Implement `@Complete` method to just return the LRA status.
```java
@PUT
@Path("/complete")
@Complete
public Response completeShopOrder(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraUrl) {
    return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Completed.name()).build();
}
```


Implement `@Compensate` method which uses the stored LRA from the database and adds the reserved (decreased)
amount of an article to the stock count.
```java
@PUT
@Path("/compensate")
@Compensate
public Response compensateShopOrder(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraUrl) {
    String lraId = getLraId(lraUrl);

    // find article stock change by LRA-ID and increment the stockcount.
    ArticleStockChange.findByLraId(lraId).forEach(asc -> {
        ArticleStock stock = ArticleStock.findByArticleId(asc.getArticle().id);
        int oldStockCount = stock.getCount();
        stock.setCount(stock.getCount() + asc.getCount());
        log.info("Compensating for Article {}: oldCount={}, release={}, newCount={}", stock.getArticle().id, oldStockCount, asc.getCount(), stock.getCount());
    });

    return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Compensated.name()).build();
}
```

## Changing to the LRA enabled version

To change to the LRA version, switch to the pre-built docker images.


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Switching to the pre-built images

We provide a `docker-compose.solution.yaml` docker file which includes all changes necessary to use the LRA enabled version.

You may simply start the environment using this docker-compose file. Restart your docker environment with

```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
docker-compose -f docker-compose.solution.yaml up -d
```

[Source of docker-compose.solution.yaml]({{% param "solution_rawgit_repo" %}}/{{% param "folder_rest" %}}/docker/docker-compose.yaml)


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3 - Rerun the tests from previous section

Issue the request from the Task 3.5.1.

* What did you observe?
* Is there any difference?
* Is the data consistent between `stock` and `order` microservice?
* What’s the role of a transaction in this case?
* What's the role of the LRA coordinator?

Use the chaos-monkey rest endpoint to inject an errors at the `order` microservice.
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/chaos-monkey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    {
        "clazzName": "ShopOrderResource",
        "methodName": "createShopOrder",
        "enabled": true,
        "throwException": true
  }
]'
```

* Rerun some tests with the monkey in place. What did happen?

You may delete the ChaosMonkey on the `order` microservice with
```
curl --request DELETE \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/chaos-monkey/ShopOrderResource%23createShopOrder \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Now create a chaos-monkey at the `stock` microservice:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8081/chaos-monkey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "clazzName": "ArticleStockLraResource",
    "methodName": "createStockOrder",
    "enabled": true,
    "errorRate": 0,
    "latencyMs": 0,
    "permitsPerSec": 9.223372036854776E18,
    "rateLimiterType": "BLOCK",
    "throwException": true
  }
]'
```

Now rerun some tests with the monkey on the `stock` microservice.

* Is your data still consistent?


{{% details title="Task Hint" %}}
Using LRAs the LRA coordinator tracks the state of the LRA. If an error is occurred it will notify every participant of
the LRA about the error by triggering the method annotated with `@Compensate`. Since our microservices now track which
entities have been created in which LRA contexts they are able to revert or compensate the changes.

You may see this clearly in the logs of the `stock` or `order` microservice.
